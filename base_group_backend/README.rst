This module was written to extend the standard functionality regarding users
and groups management by adding a new `Backend user` group that only gives access
to odoo backend (`/web`):

* minimal default access:
  * users and partners (this is necessary to access your own data)
  * mail activity, notification and channel
  * presence
* minimal default menu
  * notification
  * activities
* minimal default access rules

The problem with the `Internal user` is when you want to gives access to the
backend to a really thin part of your business to some users, it's quite hard
to properly maintain those roles over the project life, a lot of models use
that group (`base.group_user`) by default which makes hard to maintains.

So that helps creating well-defined user groups with more controls.

This modules does 3 things:
* It hijack the has_group method of res.users by returning True for group_backend users when the requested group is group_user (The need for this needs to be investigated)
* It sets the res_users.share to False for group_backend users. This allows those users to access the backend.
* It sets the bare minimum permission in the ir.model.access.csv to display the backend

We suggest to use this module with its compagnon `base_user_role`


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of writing, Odoo uses `res.users.share == False` to give the
backend access.
However to be able to access the backend without any errors some basic rights are necessary.
This module change the way `res.users.share` is computed to allow `group_backend users` to use the backend.

This avoids to write a lot of overwrite in different controllers from
different modules ('portal', 'web', 'base', 'website') with hard coded statements
that check if user is part of the `base.group_user` or `share == False` group.

.. warning::

    Using this module and grant a user with `group_backend`'s group is
    equivalent to grant `group_user`'s group everywhere `has_group`
    has been used.

Configuration
=============

To allow `group_backend` to interact with a model you can either add access rules to the group
or you can add `implied_ids` to `group_backend`.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Configuration / Users / Users, choose a user and set the Backend.

You get a users that is only able to access to the Odoo backend which you
can attach other groups that not implies other kind of users (`portal`,
`internal users`)
